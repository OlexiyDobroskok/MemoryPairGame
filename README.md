> The Memory Pair Game
> is a classic game of matching pairs of cards. The goal is to turn over cards and remember their positions to make matches. Each match earns points and the game ends when all pairs have been matched.


The game **has 5 levels**. To get a new level, you need to score a certain number of points.

1lvl = 1000 = Arturo icon

2lvl = 2000 = Denver icon

3lvl = 4000 = Tokio icon

4lvl = 8000 = Alicia icon

5lvl = 20000 = Professor icon

### Score Formula:

**Score** = maxScore - attempts * time > minScore || minScore

**maxScore** = 1000

**minScore** = 15

**attempts** - number of attempts to find all pairs.

**time** - time difference from the first card selection to the moment when all pairs were found.
